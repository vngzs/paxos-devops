## Requirements

This was built to run with the following tools:

1. [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce) version 18.02.0-ce, build [fc4de447b5](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/tree/fc4de447b563498eb4da89f56fb858bbe761d91b)
1. [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) version [1.19.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/1.19.0), build unknown

### Optional dependencies

There is some additional tooling around waiting for the container to start. I
used the following tools to build it (only one should be necessary):

1. Python 2.7.14
1. OpenSSL 1.1.0g  2 Nov 2017
1. Ncat: Version 7.60 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
1. GNU bash, version 4.4.19(1)-release (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
