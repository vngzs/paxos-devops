## Scaling

> How would your implementation scale if this were a high throughput service,
> and how could you improve that?

This implementation uses [Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic), a
Python library that uses the super-fast
[async framework](https://eng.paxos.com/should-i-migrate-to-an-async-framework)
for processing.
